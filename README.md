# GitHupdates
The wild, wonderful world of open-source software is difficult to constantly stay in the know.  If there were more hours in the day, we could all work, maintain our relationships, contribute to open-source software, enjoy leisure and sleep a healthy amount each night.  That's all fine and dandy but it's not going to happen, my dude.

Ah, forgot to mention that you need to keep up with the copious __GitHub__ projects' releases and current state.  I guess you could include other stuff like eating and exercising but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

I was visiting my girlfriend in Washington D.C., who works for a U.S. Senator, when I was complaining to a coworker about taking even a few days off from hawking project updates would set me back even more than those few days that I am in D.C.

I then asked this coworker how their staff gets caught up to speed when vacationing.  The coworker mentioned a briefing document with the highlights of events/happenings that occured while the person was away from D.C.

The obvious next question that popped into my head:  why couldn't this be done for __GitHub__ Projects?

__Here we are.__

In the same vein of popular "flash updates" such as Amazon Alexa's verbal flash briefings or a tool like [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/), *GitHupdates* will allow a user to get caught up to speed with any of the __GitHub__ projects that they desire, without the fluff.

- Determine who receives more positive feedback across all threads and `promote` them due to the assumption that they are active contributors.
